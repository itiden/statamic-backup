Fantastic, we appreciate it!

1. Make sure the test-and-lint-suite passes, this can be run locally with `composer qa`.
2. Name your PR according to [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), the reason for using conventional commits is so we can generate changelogs/release notes. Some examples:
   - `fix: backup failing due to xyz`
   - `feat: add new feature xyz`

And that is everything, happy coding!
